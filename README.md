A set of `nacl` methods implemented in Python and ported to JavaScript using the [tweetnacl-js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js).

Due to the lack of sufficient examples and a void of good documentation on tweetnacl.js, I am creating this repo for keeping track of the implementation of various nacl methods.
